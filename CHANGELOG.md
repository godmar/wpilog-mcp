# Changelog

All notable changes to wpilog-mcp will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **YAML configuration support** — `ConfigLoader` now parses `servers.yaml` with 3-layer defaults merging (top-level defaults, per-server overrides, environment variable interpolation).
- **VS Code extension** — `wpilog-analyzer` extension with `McpServerDefinitionProvider` registration and `.mcp.json` generation for Claude Code compatibility. Auto-detects WPILib IDE JDK, log directory, and bundled JAR. Extension icon added.
- **VS Code extension `.mcp.json` generation** — Extension writes `.mcp.json` on activation with all settings (log directory, team number, TBA key) so Claude Code can discover the server.
- **Standalone installer scripts** — `install.ps1` (Windows) and `install.sh` (macOS/Linux) for one-line installation outside VS Code.
- **CI/CD workflows** — GitHub Actions for build, test, and release automation.
- **`buildExtension` Gradle task** — Builds the server JAR, compiles TypeScript, and packages the `.vsix` without installing. Complements `bundleExtension` (JAR only) and `installExtension` (build + install).
- **Stress test default configuration** — Stress tests now synthesize defaults (`~/riologs`, team 2363, TBA from `TBA_API_KEY` env var) when no config file is present. No `servers.yaml` entry required.

### Fixed
- **`AnalyzeSwerveTool.poseDistance` always returned zero** — Odometry drift analysis now handles flat struct layout (`{x, y}`) from Pose decoders, not just nested `{translation: {x, y}}`.
- **MoI R² computation used inconsistent torque formula** — Residual loop now uses the same torque sign convention as the OLS fit.
- **`time_correlate` included NaN/Infinity values** — Filter now requires `Double.isFinite()`. Uses worst-of-two quality scores.
- **`FrcDomainTools.extractTranslation` only handled nested layout** — Now supports both nested `{translation: {x, y}}` and flat `{x, y}` from struct decoders.
- **CSV export struct column mismatch** — Explicit field ordering for Pose2d, Pose3d, SwerveModuleState matches header row. Generic structs use deterministic alphabetical ordering.
- **2024 Crescendo auto amp scoring** — Corrected from 5 to 2 points per game manual.
- **TBA quarterfinal match key** — Added explicit `qf` comp level handling.
- **HTTP SSE response committed before executor check** — Moved `sendResponseHeaders(200)` inside the executor task so `RejectedExecutionException` returns 503.
- **LogManager shutdown lifecycle** — `shutdownNow()` + `awaitTermination()` prevents resource leaks. Disk cache shutdown waits for sync executor.
- **Cross-correlation center lag guard** — Returns `FAILED` when center lag exceeds array bounds, preventing `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
- **`DataQuality` gap detection** — Changed from count-based to duration-based gap ratio for confidence level calculation.
- **DS timeline linear scan** — Replaced with binary search (`findFirstIndexAtOrAfter`) for teleop deferred emit.
- **Vision quality fallback** — Falls back to pose entry quality when no target entries found.
- **Overshoot detection absolute minimum** — Added `Math.01` minimum threshold to prevent false positives near zero setpoints.
- **Median calculation for even-length arrays** — Now averages two middle elements.
- **Battery voltage off-by-one** — Changed `voltageValues.size() - 10` to `voltageValues.size() - 1`.
- **`TbaClient.apiKey` not volatile** — Added `volatile` for safe publication to HTTP handler threads.
- **`health_check` misleading field name** — Renamed `cache_memory_mb` to `jvm_heap_used_mb` to accurately reflect that it measures total JVM heap, not cache-specific memory.
- **Main.java help text** — Changed stale `servers.json` reference to `servers.yaml`.
- **CHANGELOG gap threshold** — Corrected "3x-median" to "5x-median" to match code.
- **Launcher scripts hardcoded WPILib year** — Now dynamically scan for latest installed year.
- **Unix launcher missing JAVA_HOME fallback** — Added between WPILib scan and bare `java`.
- **CI extension compile restricted to Ubuntu** — Removed `if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'` from Node.js/extension steps.
- **`ExportTools` missing parameter validation** — `export_csv` now uses `getRequiredString()` for the `name` parameter.
- **Correlation guidance language** — Softened wording for moderate correlations.
- **CHANGELOG `WPILOG_BIND`** — Corrected to `WPILOG_HTTP_BIND`.

### Changed
- **Documentation restructured** — README slimmed to focus on installation and features. Detailed docs split into `vscode-extension/README.md` (extension settings, upgrading, uninstalling), `doc/STANDALONE.md` (standalone install, configuration, Docker), and `doc/DEVELOPMENT.md` (building, project structure, contributing).
- **Installation section leads README** — VS Code extension and standalone install presented as two equal paths with links to dedicated docs. Notes that both can coexist independently.
- **AI model capability caveats** — Added notes across documentation that analysis quality depends on the AI model used.
- **Default team number** — Changed from 0 to 2363 in generated config templates, extension defaults, and stress test fallbacks.
- **TOOLS.md confidence levels** — Fixed "moderate" to "medium", added missing "insufficient" level, corrected `servers.json` to `servers.yaml`.
- **`analyze_can_bus` categorization** — Moved from Robot Analysis to FRC Domain in README tool table to match code module.
- **Stress test output** — SLF4J logging reduced from `debug` to `warn`, JUnit output uses compact `tree` mode, stdout/stderr forwarded to console.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Configurable HTTP bind address** — New `bind` config field / `-bind` CLI flag / `WPILOG_HTTP_BIND` env var controls which network interface the HTTP transport listens on.
- **Configurable endpoint path** — New `endpoint` config field allows customizing the HTTP endpoint path.
- **Origin allowlist** — New `origins` config field restricts CORS access to a configurable list of allowed origins.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Lazy on-demand log parsing** — Log files are now memory-mapped and scanned in a single pass without decoding values. Entry metadata and lightweight `DataLogRecord` references are stashed per entry. Values are decoded on demand when tools access specific entries, and cached in a Caffeine weight-based LRU cache. This dramatically reduces memory usage and eliminates "file too large" errors for most files.
- **Caffeine dependency** — `com.github.ben-manes.caffeine:caffeine:3.1.8` for per-entry value caching with weight-based eviction.
- **`LogData` interface** — Common interface for `ParsedLog` (eager) and `LazyParsedLog` (lazy). All tools now accept `LogData` instead of `ParsedLog`.
- **`EntryDecoder`** — Extracted value decoding logic from `LogParser` into a standalone utility, shared by both eager parsing and lazy on-demand decoding.
- **Aggressive log eviction** — When loading a large file, the server now evicts cached logs to free memory rather than failing immediately.
- **Heap-pressure-based cache eviction** — In-memory log cache now evicts automatically when free heap drops below 15% of max. No configuration needed — users control capacity via `WPILOG_MAX_HEAP` environment variable (default 4g).

### Changed (Breaking)
- **Tool signatures** — `executeWithLog(ParsedLog log, ...)` changed to `executeWithLog(LogData log, ...)` across all 35 tool subclasses. `ToolBase` helper methods (`requireEntry`, `findEntryByPattern`, etc.) updated similarly.
- **`LogCache` rewritten with Caffeine** — The home-brewed `LinkedHashMap` + `ReentrantReadWriteLock` log cache is replaced by Caffeine with `expireAfterAccess` for idle eviction, synchronous removal listener for `LazyParsedLog.close()`, and `policy().expireAfterAccess().oldest()` for LRU eviction under heap pressure. Thread safety is handled by Caffeine internally.
- **`LogCache`, `LogManager`, sync classes** — All internal APIs updated from `ParsedLog` to `LogData`.
- **Wpilog disk cache bypassed** — `DiskCache` for wpilog files is no longer used in the load path (lazy loading from memory-mapped files is fast enough). `SyncDiskCache` for revlog sync results is still active.

### Fixed
- **Correlation near-zero denominator** — `time_correlate` now uses magnitude check (`< 1e-20`) instead of exact-zero check for variance, preventing silent clamping to ±1.0 on near-constant signals.
- **OLS singularity threshold** — `moi_regression` adds an absolute floor to the determinant check, preventing numerically unstable solutions on tiny datasets.
- **System.gc() in eviction loop** — Moved from per-iteration to a single call after the eviction loop completes, reducing GC pause latency during large file loads.
- **IPv6 loopback CORS** — `HttpTransport.isAllowedOrigin()` now accepts `[::1]` in addition to `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`.
- **Swerve angle extraction** — `analyze_swerve` now falls back to `radians` field when extracting angles from nested Rotation2d maps, in addition to `value`.
- **Percentile bounds validation** — `ToolUtils.percentile()` now throws `IllegalArgumentException` for values outside [0.0, 1.0].
- **Stale concurrency warnings** — Removed "NOT SAFE FOR CONCURRENT USE" warnings from `get_server_guide` tool output, TOOLS.md, and test suite. The server is thread-safe (Caffeine caches, ConcurrentHashMap, per-path load locking). Replaced with accurate `architecture` section describing thread safety and transport options.
- **Stale `health_check` documentation** — TOOLS.md now documents the actual response format (`jvm_memory`, `cache_memory_mb`, `disk_cache`) instead of the removed `memory_stats`/`estimatedMemoryMb`/`estimationAccuracy` fields.
- **Dead code cleanup** — Removed unused `LogManager` methods (`getCacheStats`, `getMemoryStats`, `setAutoSyncEnabled`, `isAutoSyncEnabled`, `testGetLoadedLogCount`), orphaned Javadoc, and duplicate comment blocks.

### Removed
- **`maxlogs` and `maxmemory` configuration options** — Removed from `servers.json`, CLI flags (`-maxlogs`, `-maxmemory`), and environment variables (`WPILOG_MAX_LOGS`, `WPILOG_MAX_MEMORY`). Memory management is now fully automatic via heap-pressure-based eviction. Users who need more cache capacity should increase `WPILOG_MAX_HEAP`.
- **`MemoryEstimator`** — Removed. Memory-based eviction is now driven by JVM heap pressure, not per-log estimation.
- **`LogIndex`** — Replaced by `LazyParsedLog` which builds its index during construction.
- **File-size-to-heap check** — The 8x multiplier guard is replaced by aggressive eviction + lazy loading.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **REV native binary format support** — `RevLogParser` now auto-detects and parses REV's proprietary `.revlog` binary format (in addition to WPILOG-format revlogs). Variable-length record parsing per the `REVrobotics/node-revlog-converter` specification. CAN ID translation maps native format IDs to DBC-compatible arbitration IDs. Device type detection for SPARK MAX, Servo Hub, and MAXSpline Encoder. Composite device keying prevents collisions when different device types share the same CAN ID.
- **Sync disk cache** — Caches parsed revlog data and cross-correlation sync results to disk (`SyncDiskCache`, `SyncCacheSerializer`). Reloading the same wpilog+revlog pair skips both parsing and correlation. Cache keyed by combined content fingerprints of both files.
- **Time-based revlog discovery** — Revlog files are now discovered via time overlap matching across the entire log directory tree (configurable scan depth, default 5), not just flat same-directory scanning. Supports multiple timestamp sources: systemTime entries, filename timestamps, and file modification time fallback. Files in sibling directories with unrelated names are correctly matched.
- **Configurable directory scan depth** — New `scandepth` config field / `-scandepth` CLI flag / `WPILOG_SCAN_DEPTH` env var controls how deep the server scans for log and revlog files. Default changed from 3 to 5.
- **`/health` HTTP endpoint** — Dedicated health check endpoint that returns immediately, replacing SSE-based health checks that consumed thread pool threads.
- **SSE thread pool separation** — SSE streams now run on a dedicated `CachedThreadPool` instead of the main request handler pool, preventing thread pool starvation.
- **Stdio shutdown hook** — Stdio mode now registers a shutdown hook for clean `DiskCache` termination.
- **Export directory configuration** — New `-exportdir` CLI flag / `WPILOG_EXPORT_DIR` env var / `"exportdir"` config field restricts CSV exports to a single configured directory. Default: `{tmpdir}/wpilog-export/`. Replaces the previous three-tier whitelist (log dir, temp dir, log parent dir).
- **TBA event code validation** — When a match lookup fails, the tool now validates the event code against TBA and searches for similar events by name/city/code. Provides "Did you mean?" suggestions when the event code doesn't match any TBA event.
- **No-args default startup** — Running `wpilog-mcp` with no arguments now starts the `"default"` server configuration from `servers.json`.
- **Launcher script heap auto-sizing** — The launcher script uses `WPILOG_MAX_HEAP` env var (default 4g) for JVM `-Xmx`.
- **`get_revlog_data` guardrails** — Now includes `DataQuality` and `AnalysisDirectives` when `include_stats` is true, consistent with other analysis tools.

### Fixed
- **P-value computation** — Cornish-Fisher expansion now uses higher-order correction terms (A&S 26.7.5) for improved accuracy at df=13–30. Reordered n<15 NaN guard before |r|≥1.0 check so `computePValue(1.0, 5)` correctly returns NaN instead of 0.0.
- **CSV export escaping** — String values containing commas, quotes, or newlines are now properly escaped per RFC 4180.
- **`compare_matches` crash** — No longer crashes on same-path input (`Map.of` duplicate key). Uses `LinkedHashMap` for deterministic output order.
- **Rate-of-change non-finite guard** — Both central-difference and windowed branches now filter non-finite derivatives.
- **Per-path load lock race** — Lock entries are no longer removed after use, preventing a race where concurrent threads could parse the same file on different lock objects.
- **DiskCache cleanup over-counting** — Stale files deleted during cleanup are no longer counted toward total size.
- **ContentFingerprint filename length** — Cache filenames now use 32 hex chars (128 bits) instead of 16 for better collision resistance.
- **CAN bus timestamp assumption** — `analyze_can_bus` uses `continue` instead of `break` for non-monotonic timestamps.
- **Battery report sentinel values** — `generate_report` no longer reports `Double.MAX_VALUE` when battery entry has no numeric data.
- **`SessionManager.cleanupExpired` TOCTOU** — Uses atomic `removeIf` instead of collect-then-remove.
- **`getValueAtTimeZoh` performance** — Now uses O(log n) binary search instead of O(n) linear scan.
- **SSE CORS headers** — All HTTP endpoints (including SSE and error responses) now include CORS headers.
- **PID file atomicity** — Uses `CREATE_NEW` for atomic creation plus `isAlreadyRunning` pre-check before spawning daemons.
- **`SearchEntriesTool` null params** — Added `isJsonNull()` checks for optional parameters.
- **`list_entries` case sensitivity** — Pattern filter is now case-insensitive, matching `search_entries` behavior.
- **Overshoot near-zero threshold** — Uses `Math.abs(lastSetpoint) > 0.001` instead of exact zero comparison.
- **Odometry drift scan performance** — Replaced O(n*m) linear scan with binary search via `getValueAtTimeZoh`.
- **SyncCacheSerializer null round-trip** — Path and explanation fields now correctly preserve null values.
- **SyncDiskCache write deduplication** — Added in-process `writesInProgress` guard matching `DiskCache` pattern.
- **`find_peaks` NaN/Infinity** — Now filters non-finite values before peak detection, preventing missed peaks adjacent to NaN and spurious Infinity peaks.
- **`getActualPoseAtTime` performance** — Replaced O(n) linear scan with O(log n) binary search via `getValueAtTimeZoh`.
- **PID file race** — `writePidFile` now lets `FileAlreadyExistsException` propagate; `spawnDaemon` catches it and destroys the duplicate process.
- **Export symlink protection** — `isPathAllowed` now resolves the full path via `toRealPath` for existing files and rejects symlink filenames via `Files.isSymbolicLink` for new files.
- **RevLogTools stale references** — Removed references to deleted `load_log` tool, stale "active wpilog" concept, and outdated "same directory" guidance from `wait_for_sync`, `list_revlog_signals`, and `set_revlog_offset` descriptions.

### Changed
- **`list_struct_types`** — Discovery catalog entry corrected to `requiresLog: false`.
- **`get_server_guide`** — Tool count dynamically computed from catalog size. Stale "active log" references removed.
- **`estimateSeasonYear`** — Regex pattern compiled once as static field.
- **Disk cache config naming** — Renamed for consistency: `-cachedir` → `-diskcachedir`, `-nocache` → `-diskcachedisable`, `WPILOG_CACHE_DIR` → `WPILOG_DISK_CACHE_DIR`, `WPILOG_NO_CACHE` → `WPILOG_DISK_CACHE_DISABLE`. JSON config keys: `cachedir` → `diskcachedir`, `nocache` → `diskcachedisable`.
- **Install layout** — `versions/{version}/wpilog-mcp.jar` replaced with `jars/wpilog-mcp-{version}.jar`. Versioned JARs in a flat `jars/` directory with versioned launcher scripts referencing them.
- **JDK 17 idioms** — Adopted `instanceof` pattern matching (eliminated manual casts in 9 locations across 5 files), converted `ToolDependencies` from class to record.
- **Stress test configuration** — Stress tests now load from `"stresstest"` named config in `servers.json` instead of scanning MCP client configs. Three Gradle tasks: `stressTest` (both), `stdioStressTest`, `httpStressTest`.

### Documentation
- TOOLS.md updated with `path` parameter for all log-requiring tools
- TOOLS.md `compare_matches` parameters updated (requires `path`, `compare_path`, `name`)
- TOOLS.md parameter lists corrected to match actual `toolSchema()` definitions (removed phantom parameters from `analyze_can_bus`, `profile_mechanism`, `analyze_auto`, `analyze_replay_drift`, `analyze_loop_timing`)
- README rewritten: installation via `./gradlew install`, `servers.json` configuration, no-args default startup, CLI overrides, removed legacy CLI references
- WpilogTools and RevLogTools Javadoc updated with current tool sets

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **HTTP Streamable transport** — Multi-client MCP server via `--http` flag using `com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer`. Session management with idle timeout and periodic cleanup. SSE keep-alive for server-initiated messages.
- **Modular MCP architecture** — Transport-independent `McpMessageHandler` router, `SessionManager`, `SessionContext` (ThreadLocal) for per-request session isolation. `ToolRegistry` shared across transports.
- **Game data files** — Bundled JSON game data for 2024 Crescendo, 2025 Reefscape, and 2026 REBUILT seasons.

### Changed (Breaking)
- **Path-per-call architecture** — All log-requiring tools now take a required `path` parameter instead of operating on a shared "active log." Each tool call is self-contained. The server auto-loads logs on first reference and auto-evicts idle logs after 30 minutes of inactivity. This eliminates the need for explicit log lifecycle management.
- **Removed 4 lifecycle tools** — `load_log`, `set_active_log`, `unload_log`, and `unload_all_logs` have been removed. Log loading is now implicit when any tool references a path. Cache management is automatic.
- **`compare_matches` parameters** — Now takes `path` and `compare_path` parameters to identify the two logs to compare, instead of iterating over loaded logs.
- **`list_entries` enhanced** — Now returns log metadata (time range, truncation status) that was previously only available via the removed `load_log` tool.
- **Session isolation improved** — With no shared "active log" state, concurrent sessions in HTTP mode are fully isolated by design.
- **Tool count**: 49 → 45 (removed 4 lifecycle tools)

### Fixed
- **`export_csv` primitive array bug** — `double[]`, `int64[]`, `float[]`, `boolean[]`, and `string[]` entries now export as indexed rows with actual values instead of Java object reference strings (`[D@...`).
- **`GameKnowledgeBase.getGame()` NPE** — No longer throws `NullPointerException` for unsupported seasons; returns null as documented.
- **P-value computation** — Completed the Abramowitz & Stegun 26.7.4 Cornish-Fisher expansion (correction term using `b` was computed but never applied). Full-precision normalCdf coefficients.
- **`get_code_metadata` crash** — Now handles entries with empty values gracefully instead of throwing NPE/IndexOutOfBoundsException.
- **Replay drift comparison** — `analyze_replay_drift` now compares by timestamp alignment (1ms tolerance) instead of array index, preventing false divergences when sample counts differ.
- **`isPathAllowed` symlink bypass** — Now resolves symlinks via `toRealPath()` to prevent symlink-based path escape in `export_csv`.
- **HttpTransport thread pool** — Changed from unbounded `newCachedThreadPool` to bounded `newFixedThreadPool` to prevent thread exhaustion.
- **HttpTransport batch session enforcement** — Batch POST without session header now correctly rejects non-initialize requests.
- **`loadLocks` race condition** — Per-path locks are no longer removed after use, preventing a narrow race where concurrent threads could synchronize on different lock objects.
- **Brownout end-of-log** — `detectVoltageEvents` now emits an event for sustained brownouts at end of log.
- **Recovery analysis sample limit** — Removed the 10,000-sample hard cap that missed events at >50Hz logging rates.
- **Season year detection** — `analyze_auto` and `get_match_phases` now estimate the season year from the log filename instead of using the system clock, fixing wrong auto duration fallbacks for prior-season logs.
- **Drift rate metric** — Renamed `drift_rate_m_per_sec` to `max_error_per_total_time` to accurately describe the metric.
- **`computeMedianOffset` overflow** — Overflow-safe median computation for epoch-scale microsecond offset pairs.
- **Vacuous test assertion** — Fixed conditional assertion in `ToolUtilsTest.lowQualityAddsWarning`.

### Changed
- **Percentile implementation** — Deduplicated from `StatisticsTools` and `FrcDomainTools` into a single canonical `ToolUtils.percentile()` method.
- **Dead code removed** — Removed unused `calculateRmseZoh` method from `ToolUtils`.
- **`DataQuality.confidenceLevel()`** — Now returns 4 levels (`high/medium/low/insufficient`) instead of 3, with "insufficient" for quality ≤ 0.2. Terminology aligned with CLAUDE.md.
- **`get_match_phases` guardrails** — Added `GUIDANCE_UNIVERSAL`, `GUIDANCE_MATCH_ANALYSIS`, `DataQuality`, and `AnalysisDirectives` to the tool description and response.
- **`generate_report` guardrails** — Added `DataQuality` and `AnalysisDirectives` when battery voltage data is available.
- **Discovery categories** — Added `list_struct_types` and `health_check` to the core category listing.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-23

### Added

#### Discovery Tools for LLM Agent Discoverability
- **`get_server_guide` tool** — Comprehensive overview of all server capabilities organized by category. Returns structured JSON with tool descriptions, usage examples, anti-patterns to avoid, common workflows, and critical guidance. Includes a `limitations` section warning about concurrency constraints. Call this first when starting a new analysis session.
- **`suggest_tools` tool** — Recommendation engine that suggests relevant tools for a natural language task description. Uses keyword matching and semantic understanding to recommend tools with relevance scores, anti-patterns, and suggested workflows.
- **`get_tba_match_data` tool** — Direct access to The Blue Alliance match data. Query specific match scores, win/loss status, detailed score breakdowns (autonomous points, teleop points, etc.), and alliance compositions. Use this instead of guessing match outcomes from telemetry.

#### Enhanced Tool Descriptions ("Trojan Horse" Pattern)
- **`list_available_logs`**: Now prominently mentions TBA enrichment and match score availability
- **`get_tba_status`**: Enhanced to explain TBA capabilities and direct users to get_tba_match_data
- **`get_statistics`**: Emphasizes "NEVER compute statistics manually—always use this tool"
- **`get_match_phases`**: Emphasizes "NEVER manually parse timestamps—always use this tool"
- **`time_correlate`**: Emphasizes "NEVER compute correlation manually—always use this tool"

#### Concurrency Warning and Workarounds
- **Server limitations documented** — The `get_server_guide` tool now includes a `limitations` section explicitly warning that the server is NOT SAFE FOR CONCURRENT USE. Clients must execute tool calls sequentially. The server maintains shared state (active log, log cache) that would conflict under concurrent access.
- **Multi-instance workaround** — Documented that running multiple *separate* server instances pointing to the same log directory IS safe. The disk cache uses file locking and atomic operations to prevent corruption.
- **LLM sub-agent warning** — Added explicit warning about LLM frameworks (Claude Code, AutoGPT, LangGraph, etc.) that may spawn sub-agents to parallelize work. Users must explicitly instruct agents to operate sequentially when analyzing multiple logs.

### Changed
- **Tool count**: 46 → 49 (added get_server_guide, suggest_tools, get_tba_match_data)

### Testing
- Added `DiscoveryToolsTest` with 19 tests covering get_server_guide and suggest_tools functionality
- Extended `TbaToolsLogicTest` with 5 tests for get_tba_match_data schema, description, and behavior
- All 965 tests passing

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added

#### Persistent Disk Cache
- **MessagePack-based parse cache** — Parsed logs are cached to disk as MessagePack binary files, avoiding expensive reparsing on server restart. Cache files are stored in the OS-appropriate application data directory (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/wpilog-mcp/cache/`, Linux: `~/.local/share/wpilog-mcp/cache/`, Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/wpilog-mcp/cache/`). Override with `-diskcachedir <path>` or `WPILOG_DISK_CACHE_DIR` env var. Disable with `-diskcachedisable`.
- **Content fingerprinting** — Cache identity is based on file content (SHA-256 of first 64 KB + last 64 KB + file size), not file path. Identical files in different directories share a single cache entry. No collisions between different files with the same name.
- **Version-aware invalidation** — Cache files store a format version number. Format changes automatically invalidate stale cache files. Fast mtime+size validation avoids recomputing fingerprints when files haven't changed.
- **Concurrent safety** — Writes use atomic rename (temp file → `Files.move` with `ATOMIC_MOVE`). Advisory file locks prevent duplicate writes from parallel server instances. Reads are lock-free.
- **Automatic cleanup** — Expired cache files (default: >30 days) and oversized caches (default: >2 GB) are cleaned up on startup. Orphaned temp files from crashed writes are removed.
- **Background save** — Cache writes happen asynchronously on a daemon thread, never blocking MCP responses.

#### Comprehensive Swerve Analysis (§3.1)
- **Wheel slip detection** — `analyze_swerve` now discovers setpoint/measured SwerveModuleState entry pairs by naming convention and computes per-module slip (|actual - commanded|), reporting max slip, average slip, slip event count, and slip rate.
- **Module synchronization analysis** — Compares steering angles across all measured modules at each timestamp. Reports desync event count, max angle deviation (rad and deg), and identifies the worst-performing module.
- **Odometry drift measurement** — Auto-discovers odometry and vision Pose2d/3d entries and computes pose error over time, reporting average error, max error, and drift rate in m/s. Supports explicit entry name override via `odometry_entry` and `vision_entry` parameters.
- **New parameters**: `slip_threshold` (m/s, default 0.5), `sync_threshold_rad` (default 0.1), `odometry_entry`, `vision_entry`.
- **Graceful degradation** — Each analysis section only appears if the required entries are found. Basic per-module speed stats are always reported.

#### Data Quality Scoring Propagation (§2.1)
- **All 15 analytical tools** now include `data_quality` and `server_analysis_directives` in their responses. Previously only `get_statistics` had these fields.
- **Tools using ResponseBuilder**: `compare_entries`, `detect_anomalies`, `find_peaks`, `rate_of_change`, `time_correlate`, `analyze_vision`, `profile_mechanism`, `predict_battery_health` — integrated via `.addDataQuality(quality).addDirectives(directives)`.
- **Tools using raw JsonObject**: `power_analysis`, `moi_regression`, `analyze_swerve` — integrated via new `ToolUtils.appendQualityToResult()` helper that merges with existing warnings arrays.
- **Tool-specific guidance**: Each tool adds contextual followup suggestions (e.g., "Use detect_anomalies to check for outliers" from `get_statistics`, "Use predict_battery_health for comprehensive assessment" from `power_analysis`).

#### Test Data Library (§7.2)
- **MockLogBuilder factory methods** for common test scenarios: `createCleanMatchLog()` (160s with DS, voltage, velocity, loop time), `createBrownoutMatchLog()` (voltage drops to 5.5V), `createSwerveModuleLog()` (4 modules with intentional slip/sync issues + odometry drift), `createLowQualityLog()` (gaps, NaN, low sample count), `createVisionLog()` (target flicker, pose jumps).
- **New builder helpers**: `addBooleanEntry()`, `addPeriodicEntry()` (generates from a function), `addStructEntry()` (for Map-typed values), `makePose2d()` (creates Pose2d struct maps).

#### Year-Specific Game Knowledge Base
- **`get_game_info` tool** — New tool that returns year-specific FRC game information (match timing, scoring values, field geometry, game pieces, analysis hints). Defaults to the current season. Enables LLMs to interpret log data in the context of the actual game.
- **2026 REBUILT game data** — Bundled JSON resource (`games/2026-rebuilt.json`) with complete game data sourced from the official game manual (TU17): 20s auto, 2:20 teleop with hub shift mechanics, 30s endgame, tower climbing (L1/L2/L3), FUEL scoring, ranking point thresholds (ENERGIZED 100, SUPERCHARGED 360, TRAVERSAL 50), field geometry, and analysis hints.
- **`GameKnowledgeBase`** — Singleton that loads game data from bundled resources or user-provided JSON files. Cached per season. Extensible format (format_version field) for future seasons.
- **`GameData`** — Typed accessor class over raw JSON with convenience methods for match timing, field dimensions, scoring, and analysis hints.

#### Background RevLog Processing
- **Async revlog synchronization** — `autoSyncRevLogs` now runs on a background daemon thread via `CompletableFuture`, no longer blocking the initial log load. A placeholder `SynchronizedLogs` (with 0 revlogs) is placed in the sync cache immediately so tools can detect the pending state.
- **`wait_for_sync` tool** — New tool that blocks until background synchronization completes (default timeout: 30s). Returns immediately if sync is already done or no revlogs are present.
- **`sync_in_progress` status field** — `sync_status` and `list_revlog_signals` now include a `sync_in_progress` boolean and contextual warnings when sync is still running.
- **Cancellation on eviction** — `clearAllLogs()` cancels any in-progress sync futures to avoid orphaned background work.

#### LLM Epistemological Guardrails
- **Trojan Horse tool descriptions (§6.1)** — All 20 analytical tools now embed interpretation guidance in their MCP `description()` strings. Five guidance constants in `ToolUtils` (`GUIDANCE_UNIVERSAL`, `GUIDANCE_STATISTICAL`, `GUIDANCE_POWER`, `GUIDANCE_MECHANISM`, `GUIDANCE_MATCH_ANALYSIS`) provide consistent, category-appropriate caveats about single-match limitations, sample size uncertainty, correlation-vs-causation, and alternative explanations. Informational tools (`list_entries`, `read_entry`, etc.) are unchanged.
- **Data quality metadata (§6.5)** — New `DataQuality` record computes quality metrics from any `List<TimestampedValue>`: sample count, time span, gap count/max (adaptive 5x-median threshold), NaN/Infinity count, effective sample rate, timing jitter, and a composite quality score (0.0–1.0). `ResponseBuilder.addDataQuality()` serializes these into a `data_quality` JSON object and auto-warns when score < 0.5. Integrated into `get_statistics` as reference implementation.
- **Output contextual framing (§6.2)** — New `AnalysisDirectives` class generates `server_analysis_directives` in tool responses. `fromQuality(DataQuality)` factory auto-generates guidance from detected issues (low sample count, gaps, NaN, short time span). Builder methods `addGuidance()`, `addFollowup()`, and `addSingleMatchCaveat()` allow tool-specific enrichment. `ResponseBuilder.addDirectives()` serializes into `confidence_level`, `sample_context`, `interpretation_guidance[]`, and `suggested_followup[]` fields.

### Fixed

#### Comprehensive code review remediation

**Critical & Major Fixes:**
- **Critical: Match phase timing completely rewritten** — `get_match_phases` no longer hardcodes phase durations (was using wrong values: 135s total instead of 150s). Now derives all phases from actual DriverStation mode transitions in the log, making it correct for any FRC game year. If DS data is absent, returns a warning instead of guessing.
- **Major: Cache eviction loop** — `LogCache.evictIfNeeded()` now loops until cache is within both count and memory limits, instead of evicting only a single entry per call. Prevents unbounded cache growth.
- **Major: Pre-parse eviction** — `LogManager.loadLog()` now evicts before parsing the new log, reducing peak memory usage and preventing OOM when the cache is full.
- **Major: `compare_matches` race condition** — No longer mutates the active log in a loop. Instead accesses logs directly from cache, eliminating a race condition under concurrent MCP requests.
- **Major: O(n) interpolation → O(log n)** — `getValueAtTimeLinear` now uses binary search instead of linear scan. Affects `compare_entries`, `time_correlate`, `moi_regression`, and all tools using signal interpolation.
- **Major: MoI gradient division by zero** — Numerical gradient now guards against zero dt (duplicate timestamps) by returning NaN, which is filtered by the existing isFinite check in the OLS loop.

**Minor Fixes:**
- **Rate of change average denominator** — `rate_of_change` now counts only valid (non-zero-dt) samples for the average divisor, preventing dilution from duplicate timestamps.
- **OLS determinant threshold** — `moi_regression` uses a relative threshold for singularity detection, working correctly for mechanisms with small angular velocities.
- **Symlink resolution in path validation** — `SecurityValidator` now resolves symlinks via `toRealPath()`, preventing symlink-based path traversal bypasses.
- **syncCache memory leak on eviction** — Added eviction callback from `LogCache` that cleans up corresponding `syncCache` entries when logs are evicted.
- **Brownout threshold corrected** — Default changed from 7.0V to 6.8V (actual roboRIO 1 threshold). Documentation updated for roboRIO 2 (6.3V).
- **Loop timing unit detection** — Added explicit `unit` parameter ("ms", "s", "auto"). Auto-detect uses median value instead of fragile per-sample heuristic.
- **NaN/Infinity filtering in numeric extraction** — `extractNumericData` now filters non-finite values, preventing silent corruption of statistics.
- **Initial maxTimestamp sentinel** — Changed from `Double.MIN_VALUE` (smallest positive) to `Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY` for correctness.
- **Comprehensive exception handling** — `ToolBase.execute()` now catches all exceptions and returns error responses instead of propagating raw exceptions.
- **Memory estimation sampling** — `MemoryEstimator` now samples first, middle, and last values per entry, using the maximum to avoid underestimates for variable-size entries.

#### Prior code review follow-up fixes
- **LogManager syncRevLog TOCTOU race** — `syncRevLog` now uses `syncCache.compute()` for atomic read-modify-write on the sync cache, preventing concurrent sync requests from dropping revlog data
- **FindPeaksTool misleading parameter name** — Renamed `prominence` parameter to `min_height_diff` and output field to `height_diff`, since the calculation measures local height difference from neighbors, not true topographic prominence
- **getValueAtTimeLinear extrapolation** — `getValueAtTimeLinear` now returns `null` for timestamps outside the series range instead of holding the last value (ZOH extrapolation), preventing `compare_entries` and `time_correlate` from comparing against stale boundary values
- **LogSynchronizer timezone assumption** — Added configurable `filenameTimezone` parameter to `LogSynchronizer` constructor. The coarse offset estimation now uses this instead of always assuming `ZoneId.systemDefault()`, fixing incorrect sync when the MCP server runs in a different timezone than the PC that captured the REV log

#### Thread Safety & Correctness (code review findings)
- **Critical: LogCache read-under-write bug** — `get()` now uses `writeLock()` instead of `readLock()` for access-ordered LinkedHashMap, preventing `ConcurrentModificationException` or infinite loops during parallel MCP requests
- **LogManager TOCTOU race** — New atomic `LogCache.setActiveIfPresent()` method prevents race between `containsKey` check and `setActiveLogPath` in `setActiveLog()`
- **Anomaly detection NaN/Infinity corruption** — `detect_anomalies` tool now filters `NaN` and `Infinity` values before IQR computation, preventing silent corruption of Q1/Q3 percentiles
- **DbcSignal unsigned 64-bit overflow** — CAN signals that are unsigned and exactly 64 bits now correctly decode values with the MSB set as large positive doubles instead of negative
- **R² for no-intercept regression** — `moi_regression` tool now uses uncentered R² (`1 - SS_res / Σy²`) instead of centered R², which is mathematically invalid for the interceptless model `τ = Jα + Bω`
- **Time correlation sample rate warning** — `time_correlate` tool now warns when input signals have >10x sample rate mismatch, which can bias Pearson correlation via interpolation smoothing
- **TbaClient unbounded cache growth** — TBA API caches now evict expired entries and enforce a maximum of 200 entries per cache map, preventing unbounded memory growth in long-running servers
- **LogSynchronizer configurable parameters** — Sync constants (sample rate, search window, thresholds) are now configurable via constructor instead of hardcoded, enabling tuning for non-standard log formats
- **MoiRegression null current corruption** — `moi_regression` now skips samples where current or voltage interpolation returns null (e.g., when the current log starts later than velocity), instead of silently inserting 0.0 which corrupted the OLS fit
- **Removed System.gc() from hot paths** — Removed explicit `System.gc()` calls from `LogCache.evictLeastRecentlyUsed()` (which held the write lock) and `LogManager.loadLog()` memory estimation, eliminating unnecessary Stop-The-World GC pauses
- **LogCache volatile config fields** — `maxLoadedLogs` and `maxMemoryMb` in `LogCache` are now `volatile` to ensure cross-thread visibility when set during configuration
